# Installation on Windows

The openHAB runtime comes as a platform-independent zip file.
To install it, follow these simple steps.
You will need to install Java if not already installed. Go to http://java.com to get it.
Unzip the `openhab-offline-<version>.zip` to where it is intended to be running from, e.g. `C:\openhab`.
Note that there can't be a space in the path, so it can't be in "Program Files" for example.

Start the server: Launch the runtime by executing the script `start.bat`.

Point your browser to `http://localhost:8080` and you should be looking at the openHAB portal page.
